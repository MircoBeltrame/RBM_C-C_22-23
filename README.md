# Content of this repository
In this repository you can find my final project done for the Cognition & Computation course, held in the Academic Year 2022-2023 at University of 
Padova, by proff. Alberto Testolin & Marco Zorzi.

## Project guideline
For this project we had to "Implement simulations to explore computational models of visual concept learning", starting for code used with the instructors
during lab sessions. 
The tasks valued for the project were:
* Perform linear read-outs at different levels of the model hierarchy to investigate whether sensory representations become increasingly more disentangled at the deepest layers of the network;
* Analyze the internal representations developed by the model, for example by exploiting hierarchical clustering and/or feature visualization methods;
* Visualize confusion matrices and psychometric curves to investigate the kind of errors made by the model; psychometric curves can be created by adding an increasing amount of noise to the test data;
* Explore the response to adversarial attacks and/or the capability of few-shot learning;
* Clearly explain the details of your implementation (e.g., model architecture, training and testing methodology),
motivating your choices and critically discussing the results with respect to the topics covered during the course.

## Structure of the project
All the project is contained and explained inside a Jupyter Notebook and can be executed in its entirety in Google Colab
